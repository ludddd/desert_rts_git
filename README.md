# Just another desert RTS game

This is a pet project of sort.
It’s never intended to be a full game.
I’ve used it to experiment with a lot of things (unity, tab touch control for RTS game, coding techniques, etc)
Target platform is android. (Through a PC got much better performance...)

##Controls:

Unit selection:
	- draw closed area (circle for example) around units to select them.
	- click unit to select it

Unit movement:
	- draw path and selected units will try to follow it.

Camera control:
	- (PC) WASD buttons
	- (Android) Touch edge of screen to scroll in this direction
	- Click minimap to move camera here
	- Touch terrain and wait till black cross with arrows appears. Keep touch pressed and try to drag terrain.
